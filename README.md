## Basic

1. ### What are the major features of React?

    The major features of React are:

    * It uses **VirtualDOM** instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
    * Supports **server-side rendering**.
    * Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding.
    * Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view.

2. ### When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?

    If the component needs *state or lifecycle methods* then use class component otherwise use function component.
    *However, from React 16.8 with the addition of Hooks, you could use state , lifecycle  methods and other features that were only available in class component right in your function component.*


3. ### What are Pure Components?

    *`React.PureComponent`* is exactly the same as *`React.Component`* except that it handles the `shouldComponentUpdate()` method for you. When props or state changes, *PureComponent* will do a shallow comparison on both props and state. *Component* on the other hand won't compare current props and state to next out of the box. Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever `shouldComponentUpdate` is called.


4. ### What is state in React?

    *State* of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.

    Let's create a user component with message state,


    ```jsx harmony
    class User extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props)

        this.state = {
          message: 'Welcome to React world'
        }
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
          </div>
        )
      }
    }
    ```

    ![state](https://github.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions/blob/master/images/state.jpg?raw=true)

    State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component. i.e, It is not accessible to any other component til the owner component decides to pass it.


5. ### What are props in React?

    *Props* are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.

    The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:

    1. Pass custom data to your component.
    2. Trigger state changes.
    3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method.

    For example, let us create an element with `reactProp` property:

    ```jsx harmony
    <Element reactProp={'1'} />
    ```

    This `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.

    ```
    props.reactProp
    ```
